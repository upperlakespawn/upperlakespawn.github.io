The story is a first person perspective of a mans acceptance of death and torture through ten pages of super drawn out narration. He never seems to outright say why he is being tortured or who has put him in this position. The book suggests he is a captured french capitan or official. He is saved by a french general literally a second before death.

My reason for thinking he is a captured french capitan or official is because the person that saves him turns out to be a french general, who just so happend to be there when the french invaded Toledo. I am guessing they invaded Toledo to save him because it cant just be a coincidence that the french invade on the day he is going to be killed, and go into the prison, and decide to look in a giant room with compressing metal interior walls, and find the door way then save this random guy for what seems like no reason at all.

In conclusion it seems to me that although the author verbosly narrates emotions, how things feel and death, he does not include sufficient character information, background or context to the short story.
